- Hi, I’m Gerwen Arcega (@Gerwenarc)

👀 I’m interested in web development, UI/UX design, and emerging tech like AI and augmented reality.

🌱 I’m currently learning React with TypeScript, and diving deeper into full-stack development.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-world web apps, capstone systems, or projects that help streamline daily tasks using smart solutions.

📫 Reach me here or via email: gerwenarcega23@gmail.com 

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I love turning creative ideas into working code—and I get way too excited when I finally fix a stubborn bug 😄
